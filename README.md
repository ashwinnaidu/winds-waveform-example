Hi there! I'm Ken. I'm a Developer Advocate over at [GetStream.io](http://getstream.io/). Thanks for checking out the Winds Waveform Example!

I'm working on Winds 2.0, an open-source RSS reader and podcast app. We needed a nice little stylized waveform component, so I built one using a nice little mishmash of frontend technologies.

I wrote a blog post all about it here: **insert blog post here**

And I gave a talk about it here: **insert link to talk here**

Cheers!
