# Winds Waveform Example

Hi there! I'm Ken. I was a Developer Advocate over at [GetStream.io](http://getstream.io/). Thanks for checking out the Winds Waveform Example!

I was working on Winds 2.0, an open-source RSS reader and podcast app. We needed a nice little stylized waveform component, so I built one using a nice little mishmash of frontend technologies.

I wrote a blog post all about it here: https://hoff.tech/stuff/waveform/

Cheers!
